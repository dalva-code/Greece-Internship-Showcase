# Case Study: Onboarding Quiz & Dynamic Select2 Refactor 🦩

## 📋 Overview
In this milestone for **Label MBA**, I led the visual transformation of a lead-capture tool. The goal was to convert a standard, generic third-party form into a high-end "Cinematic Neon" experience, ensuring 100% brand alignment with the music industry aesthetic.

## 🛠️ The Technical Challenge
The third-party library used for the quiz injected elements into the DOM with **Dynamic IDs** (e.g., `select2-forminator-69c536...`). This rendered traditional static CSS selectors useless.

### Key Problems:
1. **Selector Volatility:** IDs changed on every page refresh, breaking custom styles.
2. **Style Bleeding:** Default plugin styles (blue outlines, white backgrounds) clashed with the Dark Mode requirements.
3. **Asset Masking:** Integrating a non-transparent brand GIF (The Flamingo) without creating a "boxy" visual artifact.

2. Visual Layering (Glassmorphism)
To create depth without compromising performance, I implemented a layering system using rgba transparencies and backdrop-filter: blur(). This ensured text legibility on dark backgrounds while maintaining the "Neon" glow effect.

3. State-Based UI Orchestration
I used CSS advanced combinators to detect the "active" state of the quiz steps. This allowed me to toggle the visibility of global headers:

/* Hide global title only when the specific quiz module is active */
#quiz-module:not([style*="display: none"]) ~ .global-header {
    display: none;
}

📈 Results
Brand Consistency: 100% alignment with the company's "Cyberpunk" visual identity.

UX Friction Reduction: Improved mobile readability and button hierarchy.

Architecture: Zero modification of the third-party core code.
